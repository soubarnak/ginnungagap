## ginnungagap: Spaces on Void Linux

This branch (`void`) runs Spaces on **Void Linux**: runit instead of systemd, elogind for logins, LXC
instead of `systemd-nspawn`, AppArmor instead of SELinux. You still get Ubuntu, Kali, Arch and Fedora
spaces with host PAM, desktop and GPU integration:

```bash
sudo void/tools/dev-install.sh          # development install (no xbps package yet)
sudo spaces create ubuntu --preset basic
ubuntu -- id                            # or: spaces enter ubuntu
```

**Read [void/docs/void.md](void/docs/void.md)** for what gets installed where, entry commands, autostart
(`sudo ln -s /etc/sv/spaces-autostart /var/service/`), the desktop flavour, the security model compared to
upstream, troubleshooting (`spaces-void doctor`) and known gaps. Milestone logs: `void/spike/RESULTS.md`,
`void/spike/INSTALLED.md`. The `master` branch tracks upstream unchanged.

# Spaces
Spaces provide a chroot-like sandboxing environment for you to access your favorite distributions: Arch, Fedora, Kali, and Ubuntu. A simple permission system ensures your local files and credentials remain secure, even if your space is compromised. Spaces are constructed directly using packages from your chosen distribution repositories with signature enforcement. No container middleman or surprises.

## About

Spaces is a "simple" wrapper around `systemd-nspawn` that makes it easier to use and provides host integration with a couple of intuitive permissions, dbus/theming integration, and PAM.

To use, type in your terminal:

```bash
spaces enter ubuntu # or fedora, arch, or kali
```

And follow the graphical prompts. After the space initializes, you will face a familiar terminal. Except, this time, it is a real Ubuntu system you can do anything you want in. Install packages, add custom services, use docker, install vs code, your dev toolchains, browsers, etc.

Everything works as it would on a normal system. If you install desktop packages, they appear on your taskbar. If you share your screen using Chrome, it works. The only overhead is 75mb of memory and 6 seconds of booting.

By default, after creating a space or configuring it for your user, the `spaces@<your-space>` user service is enabled, ensuring that the space is started when you log in over ssh or in a graphical session. This is because the 6 seconds of startup would lead to an unacceptable user experience for novice users.

You may disable this service with:
```bash
systemctl --user disable --now spaces@<your-space>
```

This service essentially starts the system `spaces@<your-space>` service. If you want your space to run on boot, run:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now spaces@<your-space>
```

And it will start on boot. You may stop that service to poweroff your space. Once started, such as by launching applications, the service or entering a space, the space does not power down until you shutdown your computer/server. Idle detection may be added in the future.

However, if your space relies on system services accessing your user data, this will not work, as your user and its files will not be mounted on boot.  This is done partly for security reasons, and partly to avoid edge cases with solutions such as systemd-homed.


Instead, you can enable lingering for your user, which starts the user manager at
boot without requiring an interactive login. This way, the service starts with important paths already mounted.
```bash
loginctl enable-linger
```

## Security
For security issues, email: security@anatase.org

Spaces is a small daemon that escalates using polkits. The root inside spaces is powerful depending on granted permissions, and requires the same excalation pattern as the host. This means: to get root in a space, the same authentication that would be performed on the host is required and unpriviledged user processes need a normal bypass. One action is allowed without authentication: a configured user chooses to enter a space as themselves. During this escalation, the service `spaces@<space>` is also started if needed. This is ok, because the permissions and users that have been granted to a space previously used authentication, and all rootful applications added to that space also used PAM authentication for e.g., sudo. Therefore, just turning on a space does not give unpriviledged code an escalation path, regardless of whether that code is inside or outside the space.

Spaces only mounts users that have executed `spaces configure --user <space>` or were the ones to create the space and only after they log in. The root inside spaces is the same root as the host. This was chosen because user namespaces cannot do certain actions such as modify the host network (would need a bridge and would not be able to open ports) or change kernel settings. Even though the default priviledge level of spaces disallows these actions, a key requirement in design was making spaces able to change permissions without recreating them. However, this also means that spaces can be victim to a class of security issues such as improper mounts, kernel bugs, or other sandboxing holes that can cause the root inside the space to escape.

It is not possible to mount SSH or GPG directories from the host into the space, other than `~/.ssh/config` and that is additionally enforced by SELinux.

### SELinux

The `spaces-selinux` policy package provides the selinux rules separately to enable moving between images with and without Spaces. Spaces relabel `/var/lib/spaces`, `~/.ssh/config` so users moving between those images would have to relabel those files otherwise. It also allows to runtime replace spaces for development without rebuilding SELinux policy and breaking SELinux on updates (see `./sync.sh`).

```bash
sudo restorecon -RF /var/lib/spaces
restorecon -F ~/.ssh/config
```
